    Given there is the need to build a kiwi appliance for a customer,
    one wants to keep track of the updates from the distribution and
    software vendors according to the components used in the appliance.
    This leads to a regular rebuild of that appliance which should be
    automatically triggered whenever the repository which stores all
    the software packages has changed. With Dice there is a tool which
    automatically builds all appliances stored in a directory
